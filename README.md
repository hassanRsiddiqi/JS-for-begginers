# JS-for-begginers
This repository is about to those who are new in JS, want to know about JS, Some Basic and advance feature, ES6, Arrays, Objects and much more.

Let's start.

Before starting this I'll prefer you should have some basic knowledge of HTML & CSS. 
If you take an example of house, HTML is like the gray structure of our house, CSS do some decoration stuff, like painting, coloring etc, like this JS make our house use able, Like we can switch on our light, fan. Js give us the control, we can move the things with the JS.

In this repoistory I'll talk about the JavaScript, Basically JavaScript is the scripiting programming language, that allow us to implement the complex feature on our website. these days JS used in almost every web site. there are over [1.6 billion websites](https://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/) in the world and JavaScript is used on 95% on them. 1.52 billion web sites with JavaScript. Javascript is the powerfull language, you can create almost all type of application with this, like Native Mobile apps, desktop applications, iOT devices.

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language that allows you to freely mix and match object-oriented, procedural, and functional paradigms. 

Immutability is a core tenet of functional programming. It, along with pure functions, makes it easier to reason about and debug your programs.

Functional programming is about the verbs.
Object oriented programming is about the nouns.


In JS we use **var**, **let** & **const** to declare the variables. these three are differnet by scopes we will look into deep leter in this article.

JavaScript defines **seven** built-in types:

Type: A type is an intrinsic, builtin set of characteristics that uniquely identifies the behavior of a particular value and distinguishes it from other values, both to the engine and to the developer.

* null
* undefined
* boolean   
* number
* string
* object
* symbol—added in [ES6!](https://medium.com/@rogercodes1/what-is-es6-ecmascript-6-the-standard-of-javascript-and-its-features-c05a7d2ccc9d)

For storing the run time value Javascript use the Object & Array.
* #### Object
        Object are used to represent a “thing” in your code. That could be a person, a car, a building, a book, a character in a game — basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics. In objects, these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value.

        To instiate objects we use {} brackets.
        Basic syntax of object 
        var object = {
            key: 'value'
        }; 
            
* #### Array
        In JavaScript, array is a single variable that is used to store different elements. It is often used when we want to store list of elements and access them by a single variable. Unlike most languages where array is a reference to the multiple variable, in JavaScript array is a single variable that stores multiple elements.
        To instiate Array we use {} brackets.
        Basic syntax of object 
        var Array = [
            key => 'value'
        ];
